A phishing attack detection System

# Problem

Phishing email detection system -
Recently I received a professionial email from my x-employer, and pushing me to click on given link in the email. After checking it carefully I found that was phishing attack and surprisingly it wasn't marked as spam by gmail. So I'm not alone who was face this kind of attacks. It means email can harm individual by bypassing the spam filters.

# Solution

So we need to build a tool to detect phishing attack and alert the users in real time.

# How it works?
